To add any project from your folder to GIT

git init
git add . // Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
git commit -m "First commit" // Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.

git remote add origin remote repository URL //(remote repository URL here will be the GitHub URL of your project )
git remote -v //Verifies the new remote URL
git push -u origin master //Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
